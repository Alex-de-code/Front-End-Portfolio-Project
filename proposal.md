# Dictionary Website Proposal

## Introduction
This proposal outlines the development of a dictionary website that leverages the [Words API](https://www.wordsapi.com/) accessible through [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/). The website will provide users with a simple and intuitive interface to search for word definitions, synonyms, antonyms, and related information.

## User Stories

1. **Search for Definitions:**
   - As a user, I want to be able to enter a word and receive its definition.

2. **Access Synonyms and Antonyms:**
   - As a user, I want the option to view synonyms and antonyms for a given word.

3. **See Word Usage in Sentences:**
   - As a user, I want to see examples of how a word is used in sentences to understand its context.

4. **Word of the Day:**
   - As a user, I want to see a "Word of the Day" feature on the homepage, showcasing a new and interesting word each day for educational purposes.

5. **Light and Dark Mode:**
   - As a user who values visual comfort and customization, I want the ability to switch between light and dark modes on the dictionary website so that I can adapt the interface to my preferred viewing environment and reduce eye strain during different times of the day.

## Methodology
The development of the dictionary website will involve the following steps:

1. **API Integration:**
   - Integrate the Words API from Rapid API to fetch word-related data, ensuring that the API supports the retrieval of not only definitions but also synonyms, antonyms, and example sentences.

2. **User Interface Design:**
   - Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface with special consideration for readability and accessibility, taking into account the preferences of users who may use the website in both light and dark modes.

3. **Functionality Implementation:**
   - Implement features for searching definitions, accessing synonyms/antonyms, viewing word usage, and exploring related words. Ensure that the Word of the Day feature is prominently displayed on the homepage.

4. **Light and Dark Mode Implementation:**
   - Develop a seamless and visually appealing Light and Dark Mode feature. Include a toggle switch on the interface for users to easily switch between modes. Ensure that user preferences for the selected mode persist across sessions and devices.

5. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure that the website is responsive and accessible on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. Test the responsiveness of the website in both light and dark modes.

## Scope
The scope of the dictionary website will cover basic word-related information using the Words API, with a strong emphasis on user customization through the Light and Dark Mode feature. The focus will be on simplicity and ease of use, catering to a broad audience.

## Benefits
The implementation of this dictionary website will provide users with a valuable resource for expanding their vocabulary, understanding word meanings, and exploring linguistic connections. The inclusion of the Light and Dark Mode feature enhances the user experience, allowing for customization based on individual preferences.

## Budget and Timeline
As the Words API is accessible through Rapid API, there are no direct costs associated with the API usage. However, development costs and timelines will be determined based on the project complexity, including the implementation of the Light and Dark Mode feature.
